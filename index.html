          <h2 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 20px;">What is Tajweed?</h2>
            The Arabic word Tajweed linguistically means 'proficiency' or 'doing something well'. It comes
            from the same root letters as the word Jayyid, which means 'good'. When applied to the Quran, it
             means giving every letter of the Quran its rights and dues of characteristics when we recite the
             Quran, and observing the rules that apply to those letters in different situations. We give the
             letters their rights by observing the essential characteristics of each letter. We give them 
             their dues by observing the characteristics of each letter that are present in them some of 
             the time and not present at other times.<br><br>

           The Quran was revealed with Tajweed rules applied to it. In other words, when the angel Jibreel 
           (Gabriel), may Allah exalt his mention, recited the words of Allah to the Prophet Muhammad  
           sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) he recited them in a certain 
           way and he showed the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention )
           the ways in which it was permissible to recite the Quran. So it is obligatory upon us to observe 
           those rules so that we recite it in the way it was revealed.<br><br>
           
           At the time of the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) 
           there was no need for people to study Tajweed because they talked with what is now known as Tajweed, 
           so it was natural for them. When the Arabs started mixing with the non-Arabs and as Islam spread, 
           mistakes in the Quranic recitation began to appear, so the scholars had to record the rules. Now, 
           because the everyday Arabic that Arabs speak has changed so much from the Classical Arabic with 
           which the Quran was revealed, even the Arabs have to study Tajweed.
           <h2 style="text-align: center; margin: 10px;">The Purpose of Tajweed</h2>
           The Quran is the word of Allah, and its every syllable is from Allah. Its recitation must be taken 
           very seriously. The purpose of the Science of Tajweed, in essence, is to make the reciter proficient 
           in reciting the Quran, observing the correct pronunciation of every letter with the rulings and 
           characteristics which apply to it, without any exaggeration or deficiency. Through this, the reciter 
           can recite the Quran according to the way of the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam 
           ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) who received it from Jibreel who received it from Almighty Allah in 
           the Classical Arabic language.<br><br>
           Each Arabic letter has a Makhraj (an exit or articulation point from which it originates) and Sifaat 
           (attributes or characteristics). Knowing the Makhraj and Sifaat of each letter is an important part 
           of Tajweed. Sometimes two letters have very similar exits, which makes mixing them up easy. So, if a 
           person does not know the attributes of each letter, he may change the meaning of the words in Quran 
           recitation. Observing the rules of Tajweed in reciting prevents the reciter from making mistakes in 
           reciting the Quran.

  Imaam Muhammad Ibn Al-Jazari  may  Allah  have  mercy  upon  him who was a great Quran and Hadeeth scholar 
  of the 9th Hijri century, stated in his famous poem that details the rules of Tajweed:<br>
"And applying Tajweed is an issue of absolute necessity, Whoever doesn't apply Tajweed to the Quran, then a 
sinner is he."

 applying the rules of Tajweed is an obligation to keep away from the major mistakes in reciting the Quran.
